# Portfolio-Website

This is the code used to decorate and create my portfolio website found at "IPN: 143.198.226.240". I took an online course to dive deeper into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this course, we built a basic website. With this foundation code, I was able to customize it to my liking and create my own personal portfolio website. I will link the course I took for the base code down below. Hope you enjoy my portfolio website and the code associated with it. The "style.css" does have some excess code, but I am choosing to leave that for when I add content to my portfolio website later down the road.
